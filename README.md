# Design patterns

This repository contains snippets of code that demonstrate the use of design patterns in Python.
These are part of the course that I am learning from the course [Design Patterns in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-python/) by [Dmitri Nesteruk](https://www.udemy.com/user/dmitrinesteruk/).


## [SOLID design principles](./SOLID/)

These are introduced by Robert C. Martin eg. Uncle Bob.


## Gama categorization of design patterns

Design patterns are categorized into three categories. This is called the Gama categorization of design patterns. The name comes from one of the authors of the book [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides. The authors are also known as the Gang of Four (GoF).

The three categories are:

1. Creational design patterns
2. Structural design patterns
3. Behavioral design patterns


### Creational design patterns

- Deal with the creation of objects. 
- Explicit (constructor) vs implicit (DI, reflection, etc.).
- Wholesale (single statement) vs piecewise (step-by-step).


### Structural design patterns

- Concerned with the structure (e.g., class members).
- Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface.
- Stress the importance of good API design.


### Behavioral design patterns

- They are all different; no central theme.

# Design patterns

This repository contains snippets of code that demonstrate the use of design patterns in Python.
These are part of the course that I am learning from the course [Design Patterns in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-python/) by [Dmitri Nesteruk](https://www.udemy.com/user/dmitrinesteruk/).
